daily. But a version is released once a week.

me informed with fixes/ideas/questions/comments.

Tips: 

- Throwing grenades or mines into sphere teleports
  can help defend central map.

- To get away safely in a hurry use the floating pieces of land.

Facts:

- This map was created and inspired by the "Skyrim" soundtrack and the geometry
and particles from "The College of Winterhold"
