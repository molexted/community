Version Summary:
This map just keeps getting better with each update. With
two more teams added. Playing with mutator "multi" makes
this map even more action packed. Adding more structures,
doors, and textures makes this maps gaming experience more
realistic. With 4 more jump pads it's much easier to access 
and maneuver all throughout the arena. This map was designed
with a open world like environment with obstacles to take cover
or go all out offensive. Online tested and approved. Please keep
me informed with fixes/ideas/questions/comments.
